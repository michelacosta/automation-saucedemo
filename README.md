# 🧪 Automation Tests for SauceDemo & PokeApi

This repository contains automated end-to-end tests for the [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) website and [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). The tests support advanced reporting with Mochawesome.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 🧪 Running the Tests

You can use several npm scripts to run tests in various ways.

### Basic Test Runs

| Command                     | Description                              |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `npm test`                 | Runs all Cypress tests in headless mode. |
| `npm run cypress:open`     | Opens Cypress Test Runner in GUI mode.   |
| `npm run cypress:run`      | Runs tests in headless mode (default).   |

### Browser and Mode Options

| Command                        | Description                                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `npm run cypress:run:chrome`  | Runs tests in headless mode using Chrome.    |
| `npm run cypress:run:headed`  | Runs tests in a visible browser (headed).    |

### Environment-Specific Runs

Use these commands to test different environments. Make sure your Cypress config handles `envName`.

| Command                             | Description                             |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `npm run cypress:run:staging`      | Runs tests with `envName=staging`.      |
| `npm run cypress:run:production`   | Runs tests with `envName=production`.   |


## 📊 Generating Test Reports

After running tests, you can generate a detailed HTML report:

```bash
npm run cypress:report:generate
```

This command:
1. Merges all JSON results in `cypress/results/` into `mochawesome/merge-results.json`.
2. Generates an HTML report in `cypress/reports/html/`.

Open `index.html` inside that directory to view the report.

## 🛠 Cypress Verification

To verify your Cypress installation, run:

```bash
npm run cypress:verify
```
